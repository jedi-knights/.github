# Jedi-Knights

## Overview

This organization was created for the purposes of exploration in a number of technology topics for our enthusiasts.  Mostly we have similar ideas about Youth Soccer related tooling and needed a place to start getting stuff done.

## Projects

Currently there are several projects we are actively considering.

### Scaffit
A General purpose utility for quickly scaffolding projects in Go.  We intend to dog food this making changes as appropriate in ways to speed up the creation of new projects.

### ecnl

This is a collection of programs that extracts data from the Total Global Sports website and deposits it in another database for the purposes of quickly generating reports about things like [Ratings Percentage Index (RPI)](https://sites.google.com/site/rpifordivisioniwomenssoccer/rpi-formula).  This provides the user with a better
sense of where teams fall throughout the season.


## Our Vision

Our aim is simple, find a problem and fix a problem.  Hopefully we'll be able to find and fix enough so that we'll evolve into a decent source of information for parents, players, and other enthusiasts out there.
